## More Details  

This bot creates and manages roles based on the colors/themes that have been created in a discord server.  
The bot automatically manages roles in the background so only the colors used are created as roles on an as-needed basis.  
Color/Theme data is stored in a MongoDB atlas cloud database for persistence.  
This bot is built using python and the pycord discord API wrapper.
